mes-fat32
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A very sloppy FAT32 driver implemented roughly using the interface of
the sdcard driver from MES (menga-team/MES).

I don't think there is any reason you would want to use this as there
are many better alternatives, although it is very simple and uses all
things considered < 550 bytes of memory.  A file handle will cost an
additional 32 bytes.  It is very easy to tweak and port.

In its current state it supports:
 * Creating files
 * Deleting files
 * Renaming files
 * Reading files
 * Writing files
 * Listing files
 * Searching files

Currently no directories, except of the root directory are supported,
but it shouldn't require much effort abstracting the code to work on
other directories as well.

Files:
fat32.h         The header file.
fat32.c         The implementation.
port/arduino    Contains a "port" of the MES driver to the Arduino
                framework for easy testing.
